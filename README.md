# PHP's Loose Typing and Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to loose typing and division by zero.  The code appears to correctly handle division by zero in some cases, but unexpected behavior can arise with specific inputs due to PHP's automatic type conversion (type juggling).

## The Problem

PHP's flexible type system can sometimes mask errors. When dividing by zero, the expected result is often an error. However, in certain scenarios with loose type comparisons and conversions, an unexpected numeric result might be produced instead of a fatal error.  This can lead to hard-to-debug issues.

## The Solution

The solution involves adding explicit checks for zero division before performing the calculation to avoid unexpected results or errors.  Strict type comparisons and handling of potential edge cases are crucial for robustness.
